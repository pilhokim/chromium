<h1>Publish</h1>

<p>Packaged apps are published in the same way as other types of apps in the Chrome Web Store.
For detailed instructions, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/publish">Publishing Your App</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note regarding visibility of packaged apps:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Only users with Chrome 28 or later can see packaged apps in the Chrome Web Store. Chrome 28 is currently in the
  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/beta.html">beta channel</a>, but it will be pushed to the stable channel
  and be available to all users soon.</li>
  <li>Developers can share direct links to packaged apps with all users.</li>
</ul>
